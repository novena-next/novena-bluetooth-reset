novena-bluetooth-reset

There is a curious condition where, after being left alone for several hours,
the Bluetooth keyboard stops working entirely.  The only solutions seem to
be to reset the entire Bluetooth system, either through suspending and
resuming the board, or restarting the HCI device.

This program monitors the front-panel "User" button, and resets hci0 when
it detects a keypress.
